# Technology Choices and Implementation Plan

## Framework Choice: Next.js

We chose Next.js for this dashboard project for several key reasons:

1. **Performance**: Next.js provides excellent performance with features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and static site generation.
2. **Developer Experience**: Built-in features like Fast Refresh, TypeScript support, and ESLint integration make development faster and more enjoyable.
3. **Deployment**: Easy deployment to Vercel with zero configuration, and support for other hosting platforms.
4. **File-based Routing**: The intuitive file-based routing system makes it easy to organize pages and API routes.
5. **API Routes**: Built-in API routes allow us to process data server-side without needing a separate backend.

## Charting Library: Recharts

For data visualization, we selected Recharts for the following reasons:

1. **React Integration**: Built specifically for React, making it easy to integrate with our Next.js application.
2. **Composability**: Component-based approach allows for flexible and customizable charts.
3. **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive capabilities ensure charts look good on all devices.
4. **Rich Features**: Supports a wide variety of chart types including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more.
5. **Active Community**: Well-maintained with good documentation and community support.

## Data Processing: Papa Parse

For handling the CSV data, we chose Papa Parse because:

1. **Reliability**: Well-tested library specifically designed for parsing CSV files.
2. **Browser and Node Support**: Works in both browser environments and Node.js.
3. **Streaming**: Supports streaming for large files to prevent memory issues.
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for malformed CSV data.
5. **Configuration Options**: Flexible configuration for different CSV formats.

## Styling: Tailwind CSS

We selected Tailwind CSS for styling because:

1. **Rapid Development**: Utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development.
2. **Consistency**: Predefined design system ensures consistent styling across the application.
3. **Customization**: Highly customizable through configuration files.
4. **Performance**: Purges unused styles in production for smaller bundle sizes.
5. **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive utilities make mobile-first design easy.

## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Server-side Data Processing**: We process the CSV data server-side to reduce client-side processing and improve performance.

2. **Component-based Architecture**: Each chart and UI element is implemented as a separate component for reusability and maintainability.

3. **Responsive Design**: All components are designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.

4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for data loading and processing to ensure a good user experience.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Used dynamic imports and code splitting where appropriate to optimize load times.

## Data Visualizations Implemented

1. **EV Adoption Over Time**: Line chart showing the growth of electric vehicles by model year.
2. **Top Manufacturers**: Horizontal bar chart showing the market share of top EV manufacturers.
3. **Vehicle Type Distribution**: Pie chart showing the distribution between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).
4. **Electric Range Analysis**: Bar chart showing the distribution of electric ranges across vehicles.
5. **County Distribution**: Simple grid view showing the top counties by EV count.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering options for users to explore the data.
2. **Map Visualization**: Implement geographic visualization using libraries like Leaflet or Mapbox.
3. **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export charts and data in various formats.
4. **Real-time Updates**: If data is updated regularly, implement real-time data refresh capabilities.
5. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and personalized dashboards.
